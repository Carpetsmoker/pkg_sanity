Performs some basic sanity checks for FreeBSD packages.

It can:

- Check for binaries which belong to a different FreeBSD version.
- Check for binaries or libraries with references to non-existing libraries.
- List files in `LOCALBASE`  that aren't installed by a package.

Also see `pkg_sanity(1)`.
